    <h2>Beta version</h2>

    <p>TLDR: neverssl.com is improving, but you'll barely notice the change except that it 
    should work in more cases. You can try the beta version right now by going to <a
    href="http://neverssl.com/v2">http://neverssl.com/v2</a>.</p>

    <h2>Improvements coming soon to NeverSSL</h2>

    <p>NeverSSL.com started as a quick and simple fix for a personal nuisance; 
    getting online at the airport, on planes, in hotels, and at caf&eacute;s
    had been getting harder because broken "Wifi capture" networks don't work
    well with HTTPS, and the web is finally moving to HTTPS by default.</p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After using wifi in 3 airports and 4 planes this weekend, I&#39;ve created <a href="https://t.co/D2lIJuCQvr">https://t.co/D2lIJuCQvr</a> to make logging on a little bit easier.</p>&mdash; Colm MacCÃ¡rthaigh (@colmmacc) <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/790598606000533504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

    <p>It took about 30 minutes to set up neverssl.com, it's just a simple
    website hosted on AWS (disclaimer: I work at AWS) and a stylesheet designed by 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/markcwebster">Mark Webster</a>. The landing
    page is kept very small and simple, no ads, no animations, it just
    gets you online.</p>

    <p>In the time since NeverSSL launched, it's been featured by several news
    sites, technical tip columns, and lots of word-of-mouth
    recommendations. As a result, it's now grown to about 6 million hits per
    day, and that's just the traffic that makes it through to the landing 
    page, presumably more traffic is being intercepted by the capture portals.
    It's pretty rewarding to see 30 minutes of effort pay off by saving so
    many people some time and frustration.</p>

    <p>As with any unexpected success, it's important to double down. While
    NeverSSL.com is simple, over the past 18 months I've encountered a few
    edge cases where NeverSSL.com didn't work. If I can hit them on my own,
    then they probably impact thousands of people, and some improvements are 
    due!</p>

    <h2>What's changing?</h2>

    <p>Firstly, what isn't changing is that NeverSSL.com will continue to be a
    free, fast, and tiny website. Still no animations, or distractions.</p> 
    
    <p>I also want to keep neverssl.com ad free, but as it's now
    costing me about $2,000 a year to host it, I may add an single fixed
    unobtrusive logo and link, if I can find a suitable sponsor, to recoup the
    hosting costs.</p>

    <p>If you've got a better idea, feel free to let me know via the 
    next change: NeverSSL now has a <a href="https://twitter.com/NeverSSL/">twitter account</a>.
    I'll also be embeding a link to the NeverSSL twitter account on
    the new landing page. Hopefully this can serve as a useful feedback
    channel, as it's been too hard for users to reach out and make
    suggestions or complaints.</p>

    <p>I'm also publishing the Git repo I use to manage NeverSSL, so
    if you want a sneak preview of other changes I make, or you 
    want to submit improvements or issues, you can do both at
    <a href="https://github.com/colmmacc/neverssl.com">https://github.com/colmmacc/neverssl.com</a>.

    <h2>Enhanced Cache-busting</h2>

    <p>Today NeverSSL.com has a single landing page, and while caching is
    aggressively disabled for that page, users can still run into caching
    problems that prevent them from getting online.</p>

    <p>One problem is that when some browsers 'detect' that they
    are not online, they fall back to a stale in-browser cache and simply
    display the page without trying to make a request. This fails to 
    trigger the Wifi's captive portal.</p>

    <p>Another problem is that some Wifi capture networks can be
    over-zealous with spoofing DNS [<a href="#dnssec">*</a>]. These networks
    typically rewrite DNS responses to resolve to the private IP address of the
    capture portal, but they can use TTLs that are too big. If your device
    tries to connect to a few networks in rapid succession, it can end up with
    the bad DNS entries from a network it is no longer connected to, and leaves
    you unable to get online.</p>

    <p>To fix these problems, NeverSSL.com is moving to a two page model.
    The first page will be very very small, it's just loading some javascript,
    and it doesn't matter if your browser caches it. Actually it's good if
    your browser caches it.</p>

    <p>What this page will do is generate a url that looks like:</p>

    <p><strong>http://lxzmwvtdsnrhkfbc.neverssl.com/online/</strong></p> 
    
    <p>and redirect your browser there. The part before the dot is random data, 
    and there are billions of trillions of possibilities. That makes each redirect
    unique, and each DNS lookup uncacheable, so it gets through very broken DNS setups
    I don't like that it makes the final browser url a bit ugly, but C'est La Vie.</p>

    
    <h2>NeverSSL data aggregation</h2>

    <p>Since broken captive networks are a real nuisance, another change I am 
    planning is to use neverssl.com to collate aggregated data on where 
    the most broken networks are.</p>

    <p>To do this, I'm planning to add a small amount of state tracking (via
    cookies) to the first landing page. I'm still experimenting, but I
    hope that it will be possible to identify cases where the wifi capture
    was triggered and to subsequently record these measurements to a logging
    service.</p>

    <p>My goal is to publish a monthly list of the most broken networks
    to the <a href="https://nanog.org/list">NANOG mailing list</a>. I'm hopeful
    that this data will assist network operators, consultants and others in
    helping to convince network owners to fix their networks.</p>

    <p>All IP address data will be anonymized to at least the /24 (for IPv4) 
    or /64 level (for IPv6).</p>

    <a name="dnssec"/>
    <h3>Gratuitous Footnote on DNSSEC</h3>
    
    <p>Whenever I bring up DNS spoofing, people often wish that DNSSEC were
    more widely deployed to prevent it. In fact, DNSSEC wouldn't help in this
    case, or in almost any real world attack case. DNSSEC does nothing to
    protect you from your DNS resolver (the wifi capture network, in this
    case), or from other users on your network. Nor does it provide privacy, or
    protection against domains being blocked. From someone who has both worked
    on cryptography, and written DNS implementations: don't use DNSSEC, it's
    silly.</p>
