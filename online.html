    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>This website is for when you try to open Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc
    on a wifi network, and nothing happens. Type "http://neverssl.com"
    into your browser's url bar, and you'll be able to log on.</p>

    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>neverssl.com will never use SSL (also known as TLS). No
    encryption, no strong authentication, no <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>,
    no HTTP/2.0, just plain old unencrypted HTTP and forever stuck in the dark
    ages of internet security.</p> 

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Normally, that's a bad idea. You should always use SSL and secure
    encryption when possible. In fact, it's such a bad idea that most websites
    are now using https by default.</p>
    
    <p>And that's great, but it also means that if you're relying on
    poorly-behaved wifi networks, it can be hard to get online.  Secure
    browsers and websites using https make it impossible for those wifi
    networks to send you to a login or payment page. Basically, those networks
    can't tap into your connection just like attackers can't. Modern browsers
    are so good that they can remember when a website supports encryption and
    even if you type in the website name, they'll use https.</p> 

    <p>And if the network never redirects you to this page, well as you can
    see, you're not missing much.</p>
